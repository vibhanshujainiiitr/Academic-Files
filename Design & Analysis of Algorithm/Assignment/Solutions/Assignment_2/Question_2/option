       Micro  is  a  terminal-based text editor that aims to be easy to use and intuitive, while also taking advantage of the full capabilities of
       modern terminals. It comes as one single, batteries-included, static binary with no dependencies.

       As the name indicates, micro aims to be somewhat of a successor to the nano editor by being easy to install and use in a pinch,  but  micro
       also  aims to be enjoyable to use full time, whether you work in the terminal because you prefer it (like me), or because you need to (over
       ssh).

       Micro  uses $MICRO_CONFIG_HOME as the configuration directory.  If this environment variable is not set, it uses $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/micro in‐
       stead.  If that environment variable is not set, it uses ~/.config/micro as the configuration directory.   In  the  documentation,  we  use
       ~/.config/micro to refer to the configuration directory (even if it may in fact be somewhere else if you have set either of the above envi‐
       ronment variables).
