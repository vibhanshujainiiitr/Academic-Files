SrcAssgn5_coarse_CS19B1005.cpp: contains algorithm of coarse grained
SrcAssgn5_fine_CS19B1005.cpp:contains algorithm of fine grained 


Input:Input is a file named input_params.txt for two files


An output of  adjacency matrix is generated in file
 input.txt .This file contains adjacency matrix of graph (for both coarse grained and fine grained).This file is generated by the source code using random generator.


Output:Output is different for files
output for SrcAssgn5_coarse_CS19B1005.cpp is  Output_coarse.txt
output for SrcAssgn5_fine_CS19B1005.cpp       is   Output_fine.txt
